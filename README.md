# Spotify-Recommendation-System
An automatic playlist continuation which would enable any music platform (here Spotify) to seamlessly support their users in creating and expanding the playlists by making recommendations based on their choices and preferences.

## Raw Data

The data provided by Spotify is a Million Playlist Dataset (MPD) which contains 1 Million playlists created by the Spotify users. This dataset is quite huge (about 5.4 GB) and thus it has been divided into 1000 json files, where each file contains 1000 playlists comprising to 1,000,000 playlists in total.

## Data Collection and Pre-processing

Due to the humongous nature of data, the idea of scraping the entire dataset was not viable so sized down to using about 6 json files (limitations of hardware) and also decided to work with only certain important features that are extracted with Spotify Api calls. This can be found in the 'DataScrape Notebook' python notebook file.

Dataset needed to be preprocessed before modelling was done. Some cleaning was done in Microsoft Excel:

Deleted rows with headers (because they were all merged, every file that was merged had its own header row)
Removed duplicates based on track_id - there were obviously many duplicates because playlists don't all have different songs
A merged CSV file was created which was then processed.

Then Album released date were in different formats and all those formats were converted to YYYY format.
Then non quant and garbage columns were dropped. There were many columns with N/A values which were also dropped.
All the quantitative columns were standardized for consistent range.
Correlation Matrix was plotted for the data. With the matrix, analysis was done and many data columns were dropped to reduce redundancy.
Data Modelling
we tested two main approaches to handle the problem and generate recommendations.

## Model1:

The first approach is based on a user rating system. We provide the 3 different users randomly generated songs (20 in our case) from our database, and in turn, they give back ratings on a scale of 1-10 for the songs (with 10 being the highest). We then trained a model to learn their preferences and predict what ratings they would give for any other song, based on the characteristics of those given songs and how they rated them. Our ultimate goal is to give them back a list of any number of top rated songs from our mode (we chose to gave them their 5 top favourites)

## Model2:

For the second approach, we wanted to address the fact actual music recommendation systems base their recommendations off songs in playlists. When users add particular songs to their playlist, they are assumed to consider those songs “good” and to their taste, so it is quite unorthodox to base a model off songs that users rated poorly as well (as we did in the first model). The issue with this, however, is that user-provided playlists could very easily have songs that were not in our smaller database. Thus we would be unable to actually test this model on real users, but we made it nonetheless.

## Results and Discussion

## Model1:

My recommendation system worked pretty well with this approach. One of our users 'Helen' preferred the predicted playlist from the Simple Linear Regression(SLR) model over the other 2 models(Random Forest and Neural Network).

## Model2:

The second approach is validated based on CV scores. We ran Logistic Regression, RandomForest, Gradient Boosting, K-NN & created a neural network as well to classify the tracks. We divided the dataset in train/test and did upto 10-fold cross validations on each of the models. We generated the R 2 Error values and compared them. The cross validated scores were used to validate the errors generated. Also, we used cross validation to get the optimal number of neighbors for our K-NN model. Overall after the comparisons, we found that the Random Forest have an accuracy of ~0.99 on the test set which makes it a stand out model.
